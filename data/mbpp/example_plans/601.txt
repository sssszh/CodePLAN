1. Create a dictionary to store the pairs as key-value pairs.
2. Create a variable to keep track of the longest chain length.
3. Loop through each pair in the dictionary.
4. For each pair, check if the value is in the dictionary.
5. If it is, increment the chain length and set the value as the new key.
6. If it is not, compare the current chain length to the longest chain length and update if necessary.
7. Return the longest chain length.
