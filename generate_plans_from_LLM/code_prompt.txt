code:
s = input()\n\nl = list(set(s))\n\nn = len(l)\n\nif n % 2 == 0:\n\tprint(\"CHAT WITH HER!\")\nelse:\n\tprint(\"IGNORE HIM!\")
Write a step-by-step solution plan following the above code:
1. Read the input string. 
2. Create a set and iterate through each character in the input string, adding each character to the set if it doesn't already exist in the set.
3. Get the length of the set and check if it is even or odd.
4. If the length is even, print "CHAT WITH HER!", otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!".
